         Problem:
         
         If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples
         of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
         
         Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

         You'll notice that the code above has a lot of repetition. There is an important
         concept in programming called D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself). General rule of thumb,
         if you have the same code more than twice, there's a better way.
         
         In this case we can use a loop. In the code above, you'll notice that the only thing
         changing is currentNumber, while everything else is repeated over and over.
         
         So how would this look with a for loop? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop
